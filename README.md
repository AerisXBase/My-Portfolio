I'm a **self-taught developer** with hands on experience in building dynamic, user-centric web applications using **JavaScript**, **React.js**, and **Next.js**. Over the past few months, I have built and deployed multiple projects, including a full-stack **Next.js** website and several API based applications. I am committed to refining my skills through **personal projects** and **online courses** and am passionate about modern web development practices.

Currently, I am expanding my knowledge in **backend development** with **Node.js** and **Express.js**, and I’m deepening my understanding of testing with **Jest**. I continuously strive to stay up to date with the latest industry trends and best practices, particularly in the areas of **UI/UX** design, **scalable architecture**, and **performance optimization**.
