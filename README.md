# About Me

I'm a **self-taught developer** with hands-on experience in building dynamic, user-centric web applications using **JavaScript**, **React.js**, and **Next.js**. Over the past few months, I have built and deployed multiple projects, including full-stack **Next.js** websites and several API-based applications. I‚Äôm passionate about modern web development practices and constantly refine my skills through **personal projects**, **online courses**, and community contributions.

Currently, I am expanding my expertise in **backend development** with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**, while also deepening my understanding of testing practices using **Jest**. I‚Äôm enthusiastic about **AI integration**, **UI/UX design**, and building scalable and performant web experiences.

- **Fast Learner & Adaptable**: Continuously exploring new technologies and tools like **OpenAI**, **Supabase**, and **Edge Functions**.
- **Team Collaboration**: I enjoy collaborating in fast-paced, agile environments using tools like **Git**, **GitHub**, and **CI/CD pipelines**.
- **Problem-Solving**: I thrive on solving complex technical challenges with thoughtful, scalable solutions.
